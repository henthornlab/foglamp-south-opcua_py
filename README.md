# foglamp-south-opcua_py
OPC UA Plugin for Foglamp based on the FreeOPCUA (Python).

This is a plugin that creates subscriptions to an OPC UA server and feeds them into the Foglamp (https://dianomic.com/platform/foglamp/) platform.

Tested against DeltaV 14.3 FP1 OPC UA server.


Work to do:
* Move to asynchronous OPC UA from FreeOPCUA
* Enable username/password support
* Enable certificate support
